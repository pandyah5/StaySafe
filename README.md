# Toronto Armour üõ°Ô∏è
A mobile application to alert the user when they enter historically unsafe areas of Toronto.

# Description
The theme is of a dog named 'Armour'. He is a loyal companion who will help you traverse the streets of Toronto safely. The main feature of the application is to provide timely notification when the user enters a historically unsafe location. Armour will alert the user via notifications.

Alternatively, the user can also open the app to check the safety risk level of their current location. This is an open-source app as the goal of this project is to help me and my friends safely commute to our workplaces and universities. If however, you wish to show your gratitude, you can do so by hitting the 'star' button on this repository or considering sponsoring my effort through GitHub's sponsor program üòÉ

# UI Design
Here are some initial mockups of how the app will appear on completion. The design is subject to changes as we progress further.
