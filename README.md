# Toronto Armour üõ°Ô∏è
A mobile application to alert the user when they enter historically unsafe areas of Toronto.

# Description
The theme is of a dog named 'Armour' üêï‚Äçü¶∫. He is a loyal companion who will help you traverse the streets of Toronto safely. The main feature of the application is to provide timely notification when the user enters a historically unsafe location. Armour will alert the user via notifications üîî.

Alternatively, the user can also open the app to check the safety risk level of their current location. This is an open-source app as the goal of this project is to help me and my friends safely commute to our workplaces and universities. If however, you wish to show your gratitude, you can do so by hitting the 'star' button on this repository or considering sponsoring my effort through GitHub's sponsor program :octocat:

# How to use it?
When you open the application you will always end up at the "Loading screen" (See images below). When you tap on the Armour icon, it takes you to the "home screen". This is where all information is provided to you. On the top, you shall see a message indicating the safety risk at your current location.

In the middle of the page, you will have the option to start or stop location tracking. When you begin location tracking, Armour is able to track your location even after you exit from the app. Why do we need this? Quite simply, it will help us to alert you via a notification if you are at a location that has a high safety risk! We do not store your location data in any database or derive any analytics from it, don't believe me, check the source code üòÑ

At the bottom of the "home screen", you will see a randomly selected safety tip. These safety tips were derived from the Toronto Police Firearms and Shooting Dataset. We will keep them updated when we get new data.

# UI Design üé®
Here are some mockups of how the app will appear on completion. The design is subject to changes as we progress further.
